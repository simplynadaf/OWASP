## Project Overview

The project aims to enhance security in software development through the implementation of OWASP scanning on Maven Central Store Dependencies within the AWS CodePipeline infrastructure.

### Key Objectives:

1. **Automated OWASP Scanning:** Implementing OWASP-aligned scanners to perform automated vulnerability detection on Maven Central Store Dependencies.

2. **Centralized Dependency Management:** Utilizing AWS CodeArtifact in CodePipeline for secure and centralized storage of dependencies.

3. **Policy Enforcement:** Enforcing strict dependency policies to mitigate security risks by blocking vulnerable components during deployment processes.

### Project Highlights:

- **Security-Driven Development:** Prioritizing security by integrating OWASP best practices into the development lifecycle.

- **Centralized Dependency Storage:** Leveraging AWS CodeArtifact for secure and organized storage of Maven Central Store Dependencies.

- **Automated Vulnerability Detection:** Streamlining the identification of vulnerabilities through automated OWASP scanning.

- **Policy-Driven Deployment:** Ensuring the deployment process aligns with defined dependency policies to minimize security risks.
